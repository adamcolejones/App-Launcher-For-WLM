        <p>Once there is a unique window for each item, then I want to work on the tasks below</p>
        <p>Edit Media</p>
        <p>Delete Media</p>
        <p>Create an external border around each media item that can have nintendo switch hover effects.</p>
        <p>This will be done by creating a container around the existing media with a set padding</p>
        <p>Is there a way to link to other movies on other platforms but disable other links on the page?</p>
        <p>CSS animations and style transitions give a slight delay to user's percieved selection.  Remove for snappier feel to selection.</p>
        <p>For apps like dolphin, it expects certain controller inputs from a single controller.</p>
        <p>In this case, create a Controller overriding application, that lets you re-order what controller is in port 1.</p>
        <p>This way you won't have to reconfigure dolphin settings every time you play a game.</p>
        <p>At the bottom of the tag display, show the option to add more games to this tag</p>
        <p>Display tier lists, filter option that will sort media by user ranking setup per tag</p>
        <p>Stop the auto rescroll to top when the page content changes, this ruins the back button immersion</p>
        <p>If object does not have a run command, use a gray overlay to show the game is not playable</p>
        <p>When user opens the edit form for a singular media item, it needs to close if they click off onto another option or tag / tab</p>
        <p>Consider that someone may already know they want to play a game over a movie</p>
        <p>Filter Games, Movies, and Music separately for the user.</p>
        <p>What will sub categories look like, how will they be displayed?</p>
        <p>Any category should be able to be a parent, child, or individual category simultaneously.</p>
